      Puerto Rican Papas Rellenas - mashed potato croquettes stuffed with
      flavorful picadillo (ground beef hash). They are fried to golden
      perfection on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Meat and
      potatoes join together to form the perfect appetizer!

      <li>4 eggs</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by peeling the potatoes and rinsing them in cold water. Chop them
        into quarters and place them in a large pot. Cover with water and cook
        for 25-30 minutes or until fork-tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the potatoes are fork-tender, drain well. Pass hot potatoes through
        a ricer into a large bowl. Add the egg, butter, granulated garlic, and
        salt. Season generously. Let the potato mixture cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the potatoes cool, prepare the ground beef mixture. Heat some oil
        in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and brown
        completely. This should take about 10 minutes. Add the onions and tomato
        paste and cook for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the garlic, adobo, sazon, bay
        leaf, tomato sauce, and olives. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover,
        and cook for 15-20 minutes. Allow the beef mixture to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Measure out about 1/4 cup of the potato mixture onto the palm of your
        hand. Flatten the potato mixture with an indentation in the center. Add
        about 1-2 tbsp of the beef mixture to the center and roll the potato
        into a ball. You can make these as small or big as you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk 3 eggs. Add the plain breadcrumbs to a separate dish
        and season with salt and peppe
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip the balls into the egg mixture and then roll in the breadcrumbs.
        Repeat this process twice or until the potato balls are completely
        coated. Place the potato balls on a lined baking sheet with parchment
        paper and freeze for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat some oil and fry the potato balls for 2-3 minutes on each side or
        until golden brown. It's important to flip the potato balls frequently
        for even coloring
